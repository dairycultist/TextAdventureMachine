    A bright, warm day. Your adventuring partner, Jenny, has just finished helping you pack up your temporary camp and together you two set off. In your pack, a couple stacks of logs, some iron, some beds. In hers, the emeralds that you plan to barter with whoever you first reach that will take them. They clink softly every time the bag they're in bounces off her body.
    !TALKING I'm ready for adventure!

    <q purple>I'm hoping to find a village,</q> quips Jenny. <q purple>I wanna buy some tools. Go mining. Get some <i>diamonds</i>...</q> The mere thought is enough to push her into her own head, and for a decent number of paces she stares blankly down the trail, chirping to herself. Right as it seems like she's about to veer off into a tree, she suddenly throws her arm in front of her.
    <q purple>Look!</q>
    !SHEEP What is it?

    Jenny dashes ahead and disappears behind the upcoming hill. Before you even have time to press your sprint key, she exclaims, <q purple>so fluffy!!</q>
    Scaling the hill, you see what she's referring to: A flock of sheep grazing in a natural, grassy alcove.
    <q purple>These are like, my favourite mob.</q> She pats one on the head, and it bleets gently.
    !MURDER_SHEEP You hungry?
    !LEAVE_SHEEP They're cute! But we should keep moving.

    She lifts her hand from the sheep and reaches into her inventory. <q purple>Yeah.</q> In a blur, the sheep disappears in a block of red, leaving Jenny standing there smugly with an iron sword in one hand and some mutton in the other.
    <q purple>Two pieces! We can share.</q>
    !LEAVE_SHEEP When we find a village!
}

(LEAVE_SHEEP dark_forest.png) {
    <q purple>Alrighty. Bye bye sheep~</q> she cooes, and you two head off once more, leaving the flock behind. Up ahead, a dense forest drapes a shadow onto your path.
    <q purple>Woah, spooky.</p> Jenny stops and scans the path ahead. The thick leaf canopy blocks most light from reaching the substrate, making the entire forest a spawning ground for nasty monsters. Jenny peeps up, <q purple>Doesn't look too bad. We're well equipped.</q> She turns and locks eyes with you. <q purple>Are you scared?</q>
    !PROTECT A little.
    !PROTECT No...

(PROTECT hey_there.png) {
    <q purple>Don't worry, I'll protect you, darling.</p>
    !IN_FOREST I appreciate it, Jenny.
