    A bright, warm day. Your adventuring partner, Jenny, has just finished helping you pack up your temporary camp and together you two set off. In your pack, a couple stacks of logs, some iron, some beds. In hers, the emeralds that you plan to barter with whoever you first reach that will take them. They clink softly every time the bag they're in bounces off her body.
    !TALKING I'm ready for adventure!

    <q>I'm hoping to find a village,</q> quips Jenny. <q>I wanna buy some tools. Go mining. Get some <i>diamonds</i>...</q> The mere thought is enough to push herself into her own head, and for a decent number of paces she stares blankly down the trail, chirping to herself. Right as it seems like she's about to veer off into a tree, she suddenly throws her arm in front of her.
    <q>Look!</q>
    !SHEEP What is it?

    Jenny dashes ahead and disappears behind the upcoming hill. Before you even have time to press your sprint key, she exclaims, <q>so fluffy!!</q>
    Scaling the hill, you see what she's referring to: A flock of sheep grazing in a natural, grassy alcove.
    <q>These are like, my favourite mob.</q> She pats one on the head, with it not even looking up from the grass it's intently gnawing on.
    !MURDER_SHEEP You hungry?
    !LEAVE_SHEEP They're cute! But we should keep moving.
